# Report Issues

The easiest way to report issues is by joining our [Discord server](https://kitsune-lab.com/p/discord). There, you'll find a publicly accessible room called "trackers," which functions as a forum where you can create threads for feature requests or issue reports. Be as detailed as possible in your report, and if applicable, attach logs or other relevant files to help us troubleshoot. Give your thread a clear title and assign appropriate labels to make it easier for us to identify the case.

{% hint style="danger" %}
**Please do not share any sensitive information in the "trackers" room or with anyone in the community.**
{% endhint %}

If you prefer not to use Discord, you can also report issues on [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/K4ryuu/CS2-Egg/issues). Please try to details your issue as much as possible to help us resolve the issue faster.
